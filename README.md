# MTA-Major-Incidents-Analysis-2025
NYC Major Subway Incidents (2025) Exploratory analysis of major NYC subway service incidents using Python. This project focuses on data cleaning, EDA, and written insights to identify disruption patterns by category, time, and subway line, without relying on dashboards.

# NYC Subway Major Incidents (2025)

## Project Overview
This project explores major subway incidents in New York City during 2025 using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in service disruptions, contributing categories, and line-specific reliability issues.

## Dataset
- Source: MTA / NY Open Data
- Scope: Major subway incidents by line, category, and time

## Methods
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Aggregation and trend analysis
- Hypothesis-driven exploratory analysis
- Written synthesis of findings (no dashboard dependency)

## Key Findings
- A small number of categories drive the majority of incidents
- Disruptions are more frequent on weekdays
- Monthly spikes are line-specific rather than system-wide
- The N and E trains exhibit contrasting disruption patterns over time

## Why No Dashboard
This project prioritizes analytical reasoning and written interpretation over visualization-heavy dashboards, reflecting real-world analytical workflows.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
